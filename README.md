# Civilization Unpacker

Unpacks DOS version of Civilization 1 (all versions should work).
Just put CivUnpack.exe in a directory with CIV.EXE and run.
The backup will be created as civ.bak and unpacked version will be written as civ.exe.
The old civ.bak is not needed, as all EXE overlays are preserved.
